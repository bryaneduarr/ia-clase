# Inteligencia Artificial

Projects made in the class of AI divided by partials and by topic. Documentation for each project will be in each topic.

## Project use

This project was made by using [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). Recommend to use it for development or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build an image for develop and testing, this is because it contains some packages that will be used only in here and it will be better just to use it as containarized as possible.

### Docker

If you are using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) you can easily build and run the image thanks to docker-compose by using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Dev Container

If you are using [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) then use the **Visual Studio Code** editor and clone this repository using the command:

Once you clone this repository and open **Visual Studio Code** you should be prompted with a message to **Reopen in Container** or you can search this option in the command palette integrated with the editor. Once you accept this option it will start building the image and the proyect should be ready in a few minutes.
