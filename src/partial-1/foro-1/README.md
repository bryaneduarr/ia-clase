## Edges

Uses `Canny()` method of **OpenCV** to show the edges of the image given.

To run it use the following command:

```bash
python edges.py
```

## Gray Scale

By using the `cvtColor()` method we can tell what color we want the image to be, in this case we used gray scale.

To run it use the following command:

```bash
python gray-scale.py
```

##  Read Image
We are using OpenCV to display an image. We wait until the user finishes and presses a key to close.

To run it use the following it command:

```bash
python read-image.py
```

## Resize

The image resize uses **OpenCV** to resize the image on a specific size we want by splitting the image into width and height.

To run it use the following it command:

```bash
python resize.py
```
