# Capture

The purpose of this file is to take a video input of a face that is visible and scan it to detect it's motions. Once the script detects it's motions then it will make a copy of each frame into the folder `data/name` were all the images will be saved. All the image files should be ignored from the repository. It uses **OpenCV** to detect the motion of the face, it also counts how many faces it has been seen in the console and also in the image file created. Ex. `face_1_1234578.jpg`. The numbers represents the time in which the file was created.

To start the file use the following command:

```bash
python capture.py
```
